\textbf{Global Markets.} European equities are ticking up, although the S\&P
future is edging down by 0.15\%. In the meantime, the Mexican peso is
down 0.3\% against the USD, and the yield of the 10 years Treasury is
roughly flat to 2.16\%. Commodities: Oil is up 0.9\% to USD48.6 and soy
prices is roughly up to 0.3\%.

\textbf{Local News}. The Estadao brings the news the Prosecutor General
should send his second charge against Mr. Temer to the Supreme Court
today. According to the news, the charge should be based on the plea
bargain agreements by Mr. Joesley Batista and Mr. Funaro, the latter
being tipped to be the former off-the-book treasurer of the PMDB
group.

In the meantime, the Supreme Court itself will start to assess whether
the Prosecutor meet the conditions to carry on leading these charges,
after the news around the JBS affair. Over all, newspaper seem to
agree that, in the most likely case, the Court shall not bar the
Prosecutor from the case, but this second charge is likely to be
severely weakened by this whole mess triggered by Joesley's new tapes.

On the economic front, some more reassuring news. According to the O
Valor, government's sources would have leaked the information that
August' revenues are surpassing expectations. In addition, \emph{as per} O
Globo, the economic team would be considering growth of up to 1.0\%yoy
for 2017.

Finally, with regard to the fiscal accounts, the media outlet
"Broadcast" informs the auction of Cemig's former assets should
indeed go ahead on the 27th of September, as it is no longer expecting any
agreement with the company. Furthermore, according to the Folha de Sao
Paulo, there would be an agreement to vote the Refis already today,
pending the voting of the constitutional amendment of the political
reform.

\textbf{Agenda - Highlights}: \uline{Brazil}: Service figures, July. \uline{US}:
Thin.

\textbf{Bottom Line}. With global markets with little momentum and local news
kind of on the negative camp, markets look likely set to lackluster
kick-off.
